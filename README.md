# Number-guesser-starting
<b>This is a Codecademy project on JavaScript.</b>

The purpose of the project is to make functions in script.js to create the game mechanics.

The functions are:

 * generateTarget
   
   This function generates a new target number for human and computer players to guess each round.
   
 * compareGuesses
   
   This function compares the human and computer guesses to the secret target number.  Whoever guesses
   closest to the target number wins.  If both players have the same guess, the human wins.

 * updateScore

   This function updates the global score for whoever wins the round by 1.

 * advanceRound

   This function adds 1 to the current round variable.
